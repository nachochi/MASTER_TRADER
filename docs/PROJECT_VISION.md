# MASTER_TRADER - AI-Powered Adaptive Crypto Trading System

## Vision
Building a revolutionary crypto trading bot that doesn't just execute strategies - it **thinks**, **adapts**, and **evolves** in real-time. 

## Core Philosophy
**"The AI is the edge"** - Using artificial intelligence not as a tool, but as the primary trading intelligence that understands market context and spawns specialized agents for each unique situation.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Meta-Trading System
A system that first analyzes market conditions, then dynamically creates the perfect trader for that specific moment.

### 2. Dynamic Agent Spawning
Instead of pre-built trading strategies, agents are **created on-demand** with custom instructions tailored to current market conditions.

### 3. Collective Intelligence
All agents share a collective memory, learning from every trade while being specialists for their specific spawn conditions.

## System Flow

```
[TRIGGER: Manual button press]
    ↓
[DATA INPUT: Real-time market data, sentiment, news]
    ↓
[AI ANALYZER: "What type of market/chart pattern is this?"]
    ↓
[AGENT SPAWNER: Creates specialized agent with custom instructions]
    - Dynamic prompt engineering based on market context
    - Risk parameters set for current conditions
    - Strategy focus determined by analysis
    ↓
[SPAWNED AGENT: Executes trades with perfect context]
    ↓
[MEMORY UPDATE: Results fed back to collective intelligence]
```
